# Reinforcement Learning With Function Approximation

I'm exploring the stability of several agents using Q-Value function approximation. This repo includes general classes for running RL agents through OpenAI Gym BOX2D environments.

## Current Agents:

* SARSA
* Q-Learning (In Progress)
* Q-Learning with Memory Replay (In Progress)

## Current Function Approximations

* 2 Layer NN with Tanh and relu activations respectively
* 3 Layer NN with Relu activations
